## Project Spec

For my final project, I’m building something called the Diet Tracker, which is basically a simple food journal designed to help users figure out which foods are causing stomach problems or other physical symptoms. A lot of people deal with things like bloating, headaches, stomach cramps, or general discomfort after eating, but it’s really hard to pinpoint which foods are actually causing the issue without consistently tracking what you eat. Most people either try to guess, or they forget what they ate by the time symptoms show up. This website aims to solve that problem by letting users log what they ate, when they ate it, and then record how they felt afterward. Over time, users will be able to look back through their entries and start to identify patterns or common triggers. The idea is that having everything saved digitally makes it way easier to catch trends that would be almost impossible to keep track of in your head.

The general theme of the project is a personal health journal. It’s not meant to diagnose anything or act like a professional medical tool, but more to assist people in figuring out the cause of physical issues related to food. I came up with the idea partly because when I was younger, I used to have a lot of stomach issues caused by certain foods. My parents had me write down what I ate on paper which, honestly, was kind of annoying and messy. I always wished there was a more organized and simple way to track everything. A website would make this process way easier and would let people quickly go back through their history to start narrowing down potential causes. Being able to filter entries, delete older ones, or compare symptoms would make the whole process smoother than doing everything by hand.

The target audience for this website is basically anyone who tends to have physical problems related to food. This could include people who already have an idea of what bothers them but want to track it more carefully to confirm their suspicions. It could also be people who have absolutely no idea what’s causing their issues and need a place to start figuring things out. The app is meant to be simple enough that anyone can use it, whether they’re a college student dealing with dining hall food or someone older dealing with long-term digestion problems.

There are a few types of data the site will store. It will save the name of the food eaten, the categories that the food belongs to, the timestamp of when the meal was eaten, the symptom the user felt after consuming the food (if any), the severity of the symptom, and an extra notes section for anything else that doesn’t fit into the other fields. Each submission will include one of each of these options, giving users a complete picture of what they ate and how it affected them.

There are also a few stretch goals I’d like to add if I have extra time or even after the project is due. One of the more interesting ideas would be to use a simple algorithm that analyzes all the recent submissions where symptoms were recorded and tries to identify possible problem foods. This would go through and look for patterns, like repeated categories, ingredients, or specific items, and then generate a list of foods that might be causing issues. It wouldn’t be anything super advanced, but it would be a cool feature that could make the tracker even more helpful.
